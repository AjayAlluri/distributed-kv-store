# Distributed Key-Value Store

A production-quality distributed key-value store implementing the Raft consensus algorithm in Go. This project demonstrates distributed systems expertise with automatic leader election, fault tolerance, and high performance.

## Features

- **Raft Consensus Algorithm**: Full implementation with leader election, log replication, and persistence
- **HTTP REST API**: Simple client interface for GET/PUT/DELETE operations
- **gRPC Inter-node Communication**: Efficient cluster communication using Protocol Buffers
- **Embedded Storage**: Persistent data storage with BoltDB
- **High Performance**: 1000+ ops/sec with sub-100ms latency
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles node failures and network partitions gracefully
- **Docker Support**: Containerized deployment for easy cluster setup

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or later
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajayalluri/distributed-kv-store.git
cd distributed-kv-store
go mod download
```

### Running a Single Node

```bash
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### API Usage

#### Store a key-value pair
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/kv/mykey \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "myvalue"}'
```

#### Retrieve a value
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/kv/mykey
```

#### Delete a key
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/kv/mykey
```

#### Check server status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/status
```

| PUT    | `/kv/{key}` | Store a key-value pair |
| GET    | `/kv/{key}` | Retrieve a value by key |
| DELETE | `/kv/{key}` | Delete a key-value pair |
| GET    | `/status` | Get server status and cluster info |
| GET    | `/health` | Health check endpoint |

### Request/Response Format

  "message": "Key-value pair stored successfully"
}
```

#### GET /kv/{key}
Response:
```json
{
  "key": "string",
  "value": "string"
}
```
