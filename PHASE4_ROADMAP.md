## Technical Specifications for Phase 4

### 4.1 Snapshot Format
```protobuf
message Snapshot {
  uint64 last_included_index = 1;
  uint64 last_included_term = 2;
  bytes state_machine_data = 3;
  repeated string membership = 4;
  int64 timestamp = 5;
}
```

### 4.2 Membership Change API
```go
// POST /api/v1/cluster/members
{
  "action": "add",
  "node_id": "node-4",
  "address": "localhost:9004",
  "http_address": "localhost:8084"
}
```

### 4.3 Monitoring Endpoints
- `/metrics` - Prometheus format metrics
- `/health` - Kubernetes health checks
- `/status` - Detailed cluster status
- `/debug/pprof` - Go profiling endpoints

## Testing Strategy

### 4.1 Chaos Engineering
- Random node failures during operations
- Network partition simulations
- Leader assassination tests
- High-load concurrent client testing

### 4.2 Performance Benchmarks  
- Throughput: Target 10,000 ops/sec for 3-node cluster
- Latency: P99 < 10ms for reads, P99 < 50ms for writes
- Scalability: Linear performance up to 7 nodes
- Recovery: <30 seconds for any single-node failure

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Phase 4 Complete When**:
1. All snapshot operations maintain data consistency
2. Dynamic membership changes work without downtime
3. System survives network partitions correctly
4. Production deployment runs stably for 48+ hours
5. All performance benchmarks met under load
6. Complete observability with alerts and dashboards

## Estimated Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Snapshot mechanism implementation
- **Week 3-4**: Dynamic membership changes  
- **Week 5-6**: Network partition tolerance
- **Week 7-8**: Monitoring and observability
- **Week 9-10**: Production deployment and security
- **Week 11-12**: Integration testing and benchmarking

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Start with snapshot mechanism as it's foundational for other features
2. Create comprehensive test suite for each major feature
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
4. Regular performance profiling during development
5. Documentation updates for each completed feature

This phase will transform the project from a functional distributed system into a production-ready, enterprise-grade key-value store that can compete with systems like etcd and Consul.
